<h2>Variables</h2>

<h3>Reserved Javascript Words</h3>
<p>These words can be used to name variables, objects, or functions.</p>
<p>abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, infinity, int, interface, let, long, NaN, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, undefined, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield</p>

<p>const vs let</p>
<p>const is used when the variable will not be assigned to anything else.</p>
<p>let is used when the variable may be reassigned later.</p>
<p class="question">Why would I use const? I see it everywhere, but what if I decide later to change the variable?
    It seems let is much more flexible. What are the advantages of const over let?</p>

<p class="answer">Trying to reassign const will produce an error, which could be useful in debugging. This chapter
    says to use const to declare most variables.</p>

<p>let vs var</p>
<p>const and let are block scoped, meaning they only work in the block they are declared in <p class="question">Like a function?</p>
var will have global scope, meaning it would declare a variable across the whole program. This can cause a challenge in large programs. </

<p>Naming variables</p>
<p>_variable refers to properties/methods. Starting with the $ is used by jQuery.</p>

<p>change a string to upper/lower case</p>
<p class="example">
    name.toUpperCase();
    name.toLowerCase();
</p>

<p class="question">How would I create a code that could capitalize the first letter of a word and keep the rest lower case?</p>
<span id="caseQuestion"></span>

<p>Use the backtick `` for strings. This will allow the use of "' in regular sentences. Use a \` if you need a ` in the string.</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>You can send arguments through a function like an array.</p>
<p class="example">function arguments() {
    return arguments;
}
<p>Call the function and enter the arguments (1,2,3,4,5) like parameters.</p>
<p>However, these can't be treated like arrays. Do make it an array, at ... right before the last arguement (no space).</p>
<p>Use arguments in a mean function.</p>
<p class="example">
    function mean(...values) {<br>
        let total = 0;<br>
        for(const value of values) {<br>
            total =+ value;<br>
        }<br>
        return total/values.length;<br>
    }
</p>

<h3>Arrow Functions</h3>
<p>const functionName = () => {function body};</p>
<p>for one-line functions, the {} aren't needed.<br>
    for one parameter, the () is not needed.<br>
    a return statement isn't required if it's the only statement.</p>
    <p>The advantage to these is less code. Use these for short functions.</p>

<h3>forEach()</h3>
<p>Basically takes out the loop. I've seen them, and they make sense when I see them used, but when I have to use them... my mind turns to mush.</p>
<p class="example">
    let array = [red, blue, yellow]; <br>
    for (i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {<br>
        document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = `color ${i} is ${array[i]}`<br>
    }
</p>
<p>Can instead be coded like this</p>
<p class="example">
    array.forEach( (color,index) =><br>
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = `color ${index} is ${color}`);<br>
</p>
<p>Note the arrow function didn't require {} because it was only one line.</p>
