        <h2>Objects</h2>
        <p>Objects have properties and methods. Each property is a value. It is written as name:value. The value can be a string, in which case it must be in "". </p>
        <p>Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. They are written name:function(){}</p>
        <h3>Object Loop</h3>
        <p>Use for...in to loop through the properties of an object. The below example will display all the object properties.</p>
        <p class="example">let txt = ""; <br>
        let person = {fname:"john", lname:"Doe", age:25}; <br>
        for (x in person) { <br>
          txt += person.x; <br>
        }<br>
          document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = txt;
        </p>
        <p>I can add another property to the above object by doing this:<br>
          person.nationality = "English";</p>
        <p>I can also delete a property by doing this:<br>
          delete person.age;</p>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>Methods allow me to use objects by putting them in a function. I can add a function directly into the value of a property. Here's an example.</p>
        <p class="example">let person = {<br>
          fname:"john",<br>
          lname:"Doe",<br>
          age:25, <br>
          fullName() {<br>
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;<br>
          }<br>
          };<br>
          name = person.fullName();<br>
          document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = name;</p>
        <p>The this word refers to the object name.</p>
        <p class="question">I don't full understand the this keyword. I just use the property name and it works the same. What is the benefit of using this? (Answer, it can be used in a function to call multiple object names. More details in the This section.</p>
        <p>I can use the 'get' word in place of a function to avoid either reassigning a function or putting the () to call the object property. In the above example I would do this instead.</p>
        <p class="example">let person = {<br>
          fname:"john",<br>
          lname:"Doe",<br>
          age:25, <br>
          get fullName() {<br>
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;<br>
          }<br>
          };<br>
          document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = person.fullName;</p>
        
        <h3>Using Objects</h3>
        <p>convert an object to an array by using Object.values(name);</p>
        <p class="example">let person = {fname:"john", lname:"Doe", age:25};<br>
          let array = Object.values(person);</p>
        <p>This turns the object properties into an array.</p>
        
        <h3>This</h3>
        <p>The 'this' keyword calls the name of an object. This is useful if there is more than one object.</p>
        <p class="example">let user = { name: "John" };<br><br>
          let admin = { name: "Admin" };<br>
          function display() {<br>
          alert( this.name);<br>
          }<br>
        </p>
        <p>Now I can call the function by assigning the function as a value to the object name<p>
          <p class="example">user.f = display;<br>
            admin.f = display;</p>
        <p>And this runs the function</p>
        <p class="example">user.f();<br>
          admin.f();</p>
