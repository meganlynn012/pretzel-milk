        <h2>Event Listeners</h2>
        <p>
        These are similar to calling a function in the html with onclick. But this acts in the js file.
        First, call the element in the html with an id or query selector. Add .addEventListner after, then an => function. Like so.
        </p>
        <code>
          document.querySelector(".listContainer").addEventListener((item) event => {<br>
          some code here <br>
        call a function<br>
      function()<br>
    });
  </code>
        <p>Very useful.</p>
        <h3>Submit inputs</h3>
        <p>Instead of a button, use an input with type submit. Add a value as an attribute to change the text.</p>
        <code><xmp><input type="submit" value="Button Text"></input></xmp></code>
        <p>wrap that in a form. Then do the event listener as stated above and grab the form with the query selector. This will
          allow the user to either click the submit button or simply press enter.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Side note... I just learned you can wrap pieces of code in <xmp><code> tags</xmp></p>
          <p>You can also use <xmp><xmp> tags to wrap html code that you don't want to execute. Apparently they still make the text look like code though.</xmp></p>

    <h2>Functions +</h2>
    <p>Iffy functions are cool. IIFE, or immediately invoved function expression is a function that will load when the page loads. Like an event listener
      set to activate on load, but without all the code to state that. Put the whole function in () like this. Just check the console to see that in action.
    </p>
    <code>
      (function(){ <br>
        const temp = 'World';<br>
        console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);<br>
        })();
    </code>
    <p>This function type will only run once. It's great for displaying a message when the page loads.</p>
    <p class="question">Would this type of code be good to use instead of event listeners that activate when the page loads?</p>
